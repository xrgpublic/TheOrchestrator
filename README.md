## System Overview

### Key Components

Nuts comprises three main parts:

1. **MetaPrompt**: Influences skill generation based on learned user preferences.
2. **Skill System**: Allows the AI to learn how to perform any task by creating and refining skills.
3. **Memory Management System**: Determines how and where memory is stored and retrieved, including short-term memory cache, long-term memory cache, and an SQL database.

#### MetaPrompt

The **MetaPrompt** structures user input into organized categories, guiding the Brain Agent in understanding user intent and influencing skill generation.

- **Layered Information Extraction**:
  - **Layer 1**: Focuses on explicit information such as context, constraints, and content.
  - **Layer 2**: Extracts implicit information like emotions, social dynamics, and decision-making factors.
- **Current Status**:
  - **Completed**: MetaPrompt is implemented and operational in a static form.
  - **In Progress**: Enhancing the MetaPrompt to dynamically adapt based on user preferences is underway.

#### Skill System

The **Skill System** enables Nuts to learn and perform tasks by:

- **Autonomous Skill Creation**: Generates new skills based on user needs, without relying on pre-built tools.
- **Skill Structure**: Each skill has a name, description, and a sequence of steps.
- **Expert Clustering**: Groups similar skills into experts for efficient retrieval and to reduce redundancy.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Collaborates with the user to refine skills, ensuring alignment with user preferences.

#### Memory Management System

Nuts manages memory through:

- **Short-Term Memory (STM) Cache**: Stores frequently accessed information during a session.
- **Long-Term Memory (LTM) Cache**: Holds summarized data from STM that's less frequently accessed.
- **SQL Database**: Archives all interactions, thoughts, and skills for future retrieval.

- **Current Status**:
  - **Completed**: Memory storage in the SQL database is fully implemented. The system parses `<thought></thought>` tags and stores them effectively. Vector searches on stored thoughts are functional.
  - **In Progress**: Implementing the memory caching system, including weighing skills and determining which ones remain in STM, move to LTM, or get archived.

### Additional Components

#### Brain Agent

The **Brain Agent** is the core processing unit responsible for:

- Analyzing user input and context using the MetaPrompt.
- Retrieving relevant memories.
- Generating and assigning dynamic skills for task completion.

#### Planner

The **Planner** coordinates task execution by:

- Breaking down tasks into discrete steps.
- Assigning relevant skills from expert clusters to each step.
- Collaborating with the Brain Agent and VLM Expert for iterative task refinement.

#### Vision-Language Model (VLM) Expert

The **VLM Expert** handles tasks requiring visual input by:

- Interpreting screenshots or visual data.
- Executing skill steps based on real-time visual information.
- Interacting with the Planner to refine actions according to user feedback.

- **Current Status**:
  - **In Progress**: Setting up the VLM Expert is in development.

#### Cognitive Task Agent

The **Cognitive Task Agent** operates autonomously after user sessions to:

- Prepare skills based on session history and user preferences.
- Anticipate future user needs.
- Reduce cognitive load on the user by preemptively performing tasks.

#### Memory Processing Agent

The **Memory Processing Agent**:

- **Purpose**: Fine-tunes the MetaTopics and categories within the MetaPrompt based on user preferences, making the MetaPrompt dynamic.
- **Current Status**:
  - **In Progress**: Developing the agent to dynamically update the MetaPrompt based on stored user interactions.
